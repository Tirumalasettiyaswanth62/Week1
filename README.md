# week1
In the week 1 I learnt about 
Verilog RTL design and simulation
Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis
Logic synthesis using Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization techniques
